# All About ReactJS

I'll be working on 20 different ReactJS projects over the next 50 days. I would also be deploying all the projects so that it is easy to visualise the projects.

1. **TodoApp &nbsp;â˜‘**: A responsive ToDo app with functionalities of adding new todos, editing and deleting existing todos. Also, data persistence is achieved by storing the todos in browser's localStorage.

2. **Pricing Cards &nbsp;ðŸ’¸**: A responsive imitation of pricing cards. Also, introduced dark theme, where text colours and background colours are changed based on the theme activated.

3. **Calculator &nbsp;âž•âž–**: A responsive calculator which performs basic mathematical operations. Made use of ```eval``` (not recommended) to evaluate the expression string.

4. **Color Picker &nbsp;ðŸŽ¨**: A responsive color picker which allows user to select a color from randomly generated color palette, or choose a color of choice which gets set as background color of the header. Implemented various color util methods to help create this exercise.
