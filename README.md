# 45DaysOfReactJS

I'll be working on 20 different ReactJS projects over the course of 45 days. I would also be deploying all the projects so that it is easy to visualise the projects.

1. **TodoApp &nbsp;â˜‘**: A response ToDo app with functionalities of adding new todos, editing and deleting existing todos. Also, data persistence is achieved by storing the todos in browser's localStorage.
