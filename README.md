I'll be working on 20 different ReactJS projects over the next 50 days. I would also be deploying all the projects so that it is easy to visualize the projects.

1. **TodoApp &nbsp;‚òë**: A responsive [ToDo](https://demondaddy22.github.io/all-about-reactJS/#/todos) app with functionalities of adding new todos, editing, and deleting existing todos. Also, data persistence is achieved by storing the todos in the browser's localStorage.

2. **Pricing Cards &nbsp;üí∏**: A responsive imitation of [pricing cards](https://demondaddy22.github.io/all-about-reactJS/#/pricing-cards). Also, introduced a dark theme, where text colors and background colors are changed based on the theme activated.

3. **Calculator &nbsp;‚ûï‚ûñ**: A responsive [calculator](https://demondaddy22.github.io/all-about-reactJS/#/calculator) that performs basic mathematical operations. Made use of ```eval``` (not recommended) to evaluate the expression string.

4. **Color Picker &nbsp;üé®**: A responsive [color picker](https://demondaddy22.github.io/all-about-reactJS/#/color-picker) which allows user to select a color from a randomly generated color palette, or choose a color of choice which gets set as the background color of the header. Implemented various color util methods to help create this exercise.

5. **GitHub Profile Viewer &nbsp;üôã**: A responsive [GitHub Profile Viewer](https://demondaddy22.github.io/all-about-reactJS/#/github-profile-viewer) which clones the view of searched user's GitHub profile by listing his/her profile details and repo summaries. Made use of GitHub API to fetch details of the searched user.

6. **Stone-Paper-Scissor &nbsp;‚úÇ**: A responsive [Stone-Paper-Scissor](https://demondaddy22.github.io/all-about-reactJS/#/stone-paper-scissor) game built using React Hooks. The score is persisted using the browser's localStorage.

7. **Password Generator &nbsp;üîê**: A responsive [password generator](https://demondaddy22.github.io/all-about-reactJS/#/password-generator) that allows the user to generate a password of specified length containing a random sequence of lowercase, uppercase, numeric or special characters. The user can also click on the generated password to copy it to the clipboard.
