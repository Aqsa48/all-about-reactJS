# 45DaysOfReactJS

I'll be working on 20 different ReactJS projects over the course of 45 days. I would also be deploying all the projects so that it is easy to visualise the projects.

1. **TodoApp &nbsp;â˜‘**: A responsive ToDo app with functionalities of adding new todos, editing and deleting existing todos. Also, data persistence is achieved by storing the todos in browser's localStorage.

2. **Pricing Cards &nbsp;ðŸ’¸**: A responsive imitation of pricing cards. Also, introduced dark theme, where text colours and background colours are changed based on the theme activated.
